we used push buttons as sensors.

HOW and WHY? 

by attaching a bar above the lane at 40 cm, then adding 3 sticks with different lengths 15cm, 25cm, and 35 cm.
 once the box passes under the bar it will move the stick forward while it's attaching with the bar the stick will bend
 a little bit and allowing us to know what the dimensions of the box are. 
10x10 box will move the longest stick (35 cm), 20x20 box will move both the longest and the middle stick,
 and 30x30 box will move all sticks.
